# Welcome

__Docs__ is a tool to help you easily include documentation with your PyroCMS modules. 

## How does it work?

You will create a new folder in your module called __docs__.  Within that folder you will create files like you would in a normal views folder. 


## Additional Tools

__Docs__ provides some additional plugins and methods to help you in writing documentation. These tools include things like automatic conversion of Markdown or Textile format pages, automatic nav creation, {{ docs:link url="tools#docs:link" text="link helper" }}, {{ docs:link url="tools#docs:partial" text="partial including" }}, and more. See full tools available on {{ docs:link url="tools" text="the tools page" }}.


## Inspirational Speech

Great documentation is such an important part of your code. What good will your code do if it's not documented? Users will have to scour your source to understand what is going on. Let's be honest, most devs are too lazy to do that. Help everyone understand how to get the full benefits of your awesome code by providing proper documentation. One of the top comments on CodeIgniter is it's well documented code. We should all live by the same standards in the work we provide.
