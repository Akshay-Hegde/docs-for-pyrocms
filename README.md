# Docs

Docs is a PyroCMS module that allows you to easily include documentation bundled up with your module. This helps you keep the relative documentation with the correct version, and keep your docs up to date when you change your code.

## How ?

__Docs__ will allow you to include a _docs_ folder along with your module which can be served up for viewing in the admin area. Files can be written in Markdown, Textile, or plain HTML, and can be themed using the regular PyroCMS theme format. This means you can include LEX code and other data from within your CMS inside your documentation. 

## Installation Instructions

Install __Docs__ like you would any other module. Once installed, you can view the __Docs__ documentation in your admin panel at `admin/docs/docs`. If you have already written your own documentation, you can view it at `admin/docs/MODULE_NAME`. Docs is targeted at PyroCMS 2.2 but may work with 2.1.

## Beta

__Docs__ is currently in beta with a basic working state. New features are being developed and the API / documentation may change frequently. Until we are out of beta, we will be keeping a list of changes, bugs, and to dos in our [docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) file.
